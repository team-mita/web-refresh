/*  External style sheet for MITA website

Notes on media queries (NAE):
		I've added media queries to this stylesheet that lay out the
		groundwork for Mobile-First design. All "base" styles (those not included in a media query)
		should be geared toward mobile devices, with more specific styling for
		larger devices "layering" on top of this using the media queries. This practice
		continues to layer more specific/complex styles as the screen gets larger, with
		the largest being the most specific.

		Below is a good article describing mobile-first design:

		And here is w3school's description of media breakpoints:
